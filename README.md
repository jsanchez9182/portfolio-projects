## Project Descriptions 
___ 
### [Encore Data Analysis](https://github.com/jsanchez9182/portfolio-projects/blob/master/encore-data-analysis/debt_data_analysis.ipynb)
* Identified trends, issues and made recommondations to improve business interactions with consumers based on Encore Capital Group data.
* The data was obtained from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's consumer complaint database.

### Airbnb Data Web application(https://jsanchez2393.shinyapps.io/airbnb-data-webapp/)
* Created an easily interpretable and interactive map capable of identifying bargains for Airbnb customers in the New York city area using shiny.
* Initially deployed the application on an AWS ec2 instance.
* Moved to shinyapps.io

### [Predicting Kaggle Housing Dataset Prices](https://github.com/jsanchez9182/portfolio-projects/blob/master/predicting-house-prices/kaggle_house_prices.ipynb)
* Utilized, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels and other python libraries to create an easily interpretable robust linear regression model capable of estimating the price of homes and identifying potential outliers.
* The robust linear regression model accounted for approximately 90% of the variation in the out of sample sale price of homes while utilizing only 12 features.
* Also made recommendations to improve data storage procedures.

### [Predicting Patient Survival using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/jsanchez9182/portfolio-projects/blob/master/predicting-patient-survival/predicting-patient-survival.pdf)
* Used ggplot, dplyr and other packages in R in order to create a logistic regression model which assessed a patients' risk of death based on physiological parameters. 
* Despite a small sample size a sensitivity of 80%, and a specificity of approximately 70% were achieved. 

### [Spam Email Classification](https://github.com/jsanchez9182/portfolio-projects/blob/master/spam_email_classification/spam_email_classification.pdf)
* Created decision tree models capable of classifying email as legitimate or spam in R. 
* The second decision tree model had weights applied in order to penalize false positives (misclassifying legitimate emails as spam) more harshly.
* The second decision tree model achieved an error rate of about 13% with a false positive error rate of approximately 1% and a false negative error rate of approximately 12%. 

### [Framingham Heart Study](https://github.com/jsanchez9182/portfolio-projects/blob/master/framingham-heart-study/Framingham_heart_study.docx)
* Worked with a team in order to develop a logistic regression model capable of assessing a person's risk of developing coronary heart disease based on physiological parameters and habits. 
* A prediction accuracy of approximately 85% was achieved.
